# multibrotIA

This java file was created for an assignment in school. It was a quite version written in Java and produces black and white Multibrot renders.


I am aware that this code is currently terrible, and needs to be cleaned up. I think it would be interesting to see how I could improve this code and compare the two. I wonder how much progress I have made as a programmer over these years...
